* Java related technologies.
* Kafka and other distributed streaming platforms.
* Microservices, Spring-Boot, Cloud.
* Tackling new challenges with innovative solutions.
* Being surrounded by passionate tech lovers.
* SCALA has recently sparked my interest after attending Scala Days '17 in Chicago (since we are headed towards multi-core and concurrent processing - better solutions and functional programming might be inevitable for more and more use cases and skillsets).
