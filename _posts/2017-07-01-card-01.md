Continued growth of PCLN hotel platform focusing on performance, modularity, and maintainability. Most recently helped expand "meta-search" services by re-designing and rolling out new 'AllRates API' with dynamic deal pricing engine and 50%+ faster response times (using AVRO schema for serialization in persistance layer). This unlocked distribution of special pricing to metas with immediate impact on bottom line. Owner of cache22 platform, mentor to others.
